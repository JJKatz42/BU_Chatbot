First, Communications focuses on both oral elements - including development of a presenter's delivery skills and message clarity - and writing elements - including how to exercise leadership through writing and understanding how strategies of written communication are an essential aspect of effective management. Second, Teaming will support student work on teams while also assessing the dynamics by which teams form, develop, change, achieve success and transform or disband. Third, Career Management will assist students in transforming personal interests into professional goals, and these goals into an MBA level, candidate-driven internship and job search through a set of complementary resources and activities. Each of the three professional skills elements are integrated within, and delivered alongside, the integrated modular MBA core experience.
